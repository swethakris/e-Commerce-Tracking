# e-Commerce-Tracking

The online marketing space is in constant shift as new technologies, services, and marketing tactics gain popularity and become the new standard. Online store owners are one of the many different segments affected by these constant evolutions. In order for these business owners to survive and thrive, they need to be able to make better decisions faster. This is where web analytics comes into play. Enhanced Ecommerce was rolled out as one of the major improvements of Universal Analytics. It is an improved version of the ecommerce tracking available in Classic Analytics (ga.js). That previous version of Google ecommerce tracking did a good job of collecting information about online transactions, but it was unable to provide insights into how customers arrived at those transactions. Enhanced Ecommerce captures the more complex processes that customers go through before and after they make purchases: viewing and interacting with products, adding and removing items from their shopping carts, responding to promotions, or requesting refunds.
